* Learn how to model software and how to build it from the ground up
* Be able to write code that fulfills a set of requirements
* Work with a database
* At the end it should be understood how Python web apps are structured and can be developed

## Schedule

## Sessions
### Session 1 - Programming Basics
#### Theory
* Computer basics for Kids: What is a CPU? What is RAM? What is a disk?
* RAM, variables and addresses
* Demo a simple calculator in Scratch
* Controll structures
* Demo loops and if statements

#### Exercise
1. Login to the computer
2. Open Scratch
3. Open the prepared project and play with it: The cat will step further if a calculation was completed successfully.
4. Understand the variables and the controll strucutres
5. Open the IDE and run the CLI application, that has the same logic
